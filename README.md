Align three sequence using Quadratic space
===========================================

Space not running time is often the factor limiting the application of dynamic programming. 
Often cubic space is required to align three sequences (3D dynamic programming). Given this 
space requirement, alignment of three genes with a length of more than 1000 characters is 
almost infeasible in most of our modern computers. Here, by using a divide conque technique, 
I implemented alignment of three sequences in quadratic space. The idea of this implementation 
is similar to Hirschberg\'s algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschberg's_algorithm, which 
I have an implmentation in Python, see https://github.com/wuzhigang05/Dynamic-Programming-Linear-Space.git
